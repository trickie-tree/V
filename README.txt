# Vibrational_spectroscopy_web_apps
A selection of web based apps to plot, process, and analyse vibrational spectra

Current apps:
            - PLotting spectrum: With the goal of adding pre-processing functionality 
            - PCA: Proving the capacity to plot score, loadings, cumulative explained variance (and possibly PCA hyperspectral images) 

Planned apps:
            - Spectral analysis app: Looking at quanifying the quality of either an individual spectrum or spectral dataset (or both)
